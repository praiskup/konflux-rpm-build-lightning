How to (re)generate manual page:
--------------------------------

1. apply the `help.patch` to cpio sources and then re-build sources

2. run help2man on cpio shell wrapper:
    `cpio_binary=../cpio-2.12/src/cpio help2man ./cpio > latest-output`

3. note the changes in `git diff latest-output`, those will probably need
   manual tweaking in resulting manual page.

4. move the generated file on place:
    `cp latest-output ../cpio.1`

5. apply `downstream.patch`
     `cd .. ; patch -p1 cpio.1 < man/downstream.patch`

6. fix collisions and regenerate `downstream.patch`
      `diff -u man/latest-output cpio.1 > man/downstream.patch`
